This is our offline version of the GrayMail chat client.  This client is designed to piggyback onto another chat service (G-Chat, Facebook Chat, even email).  To learn more about the GrayMail protocol and security discussion, please see:

To use this software (simple way):
Open up the offline GrayMail app into two browser windows.  Have each window send their public key to the other side (Hit "Go" to open up the dialog to enter yours).  Continue swapping the required messages with the other peer until an encrypted session is set up.  You can now encrypt a plaintext, send the ciphertext to the other peer, and then decrypt any messages they send to you.
